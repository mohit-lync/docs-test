# API Overview

Here's a basic overview of the API endpoints provided by LYNC for wallet creation and transactions on the Supra blockchain network.

These APIs enables the management of wallets by providing endpoints for creating new wallets and retrieving existing ones. Each wallet is associated with a unique address and private key. These APIs also facilitate the minting of NFT transactions and any generic transactions on the Supra blockchain network. You can easily integrate mint NFT transactions and any generic transactions on Supra using our APIs.
