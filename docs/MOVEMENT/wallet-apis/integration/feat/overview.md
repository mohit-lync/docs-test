# API Overview

Here's a basic overview of the API endpoints provided by Lync for wallet creation and transactions on the Movement blockchain network.

These APIs enables the management of wallets by providing endpoints for creating new wallets and retrieving existing ones. Each wallet is associated with a unique address and private key. These APIs also facilitate the minting of NFT transactions and any generic transactions on the Movement blockchain network. You can easily integrate mint NFT transactions and any generic transactions on Movement using our APIs.
